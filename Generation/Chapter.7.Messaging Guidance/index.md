#SCP ADW Additional Messaging Guidance#

The <a href="SCP-ADW-AdditionalMessagingGuidance-v1.0.pdf"> SCP ADW Additional Messaging Guidance document</a> provides additional guidance to support the implementation of the HL7 FHIR message specifications that have been developed for Assessment, Discharge and Withdrawal (ADW) Notices.

The document should be read in conjunction with the [Social Care Domain Message Specification (DMS)]  and the [SCCI2075 Assessment, Discharge and Withdrawal Notices between Hospitals and Social Services Information Standard].

The document provides supplementary information covering the implementation and use of the ADW FHIR messages and also describes a number of divergences from the ADW Information Standard. It is anticipated that the document will evolve based on feedback received from implementers.
